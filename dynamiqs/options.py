class Options(eqx.Module):
    """Generic options for quantum solvers.

    The `Options` class provides a unified interface for specifying options specific to
    quantum solvers. Each quantum solver may only use a subset of these options,
    so if you modify an option that the solver does not recognize from its default
    value, an error is raised.

    === "`dq.sesolve`"
        **Parameters**

        - **save_states** – If `True`, the state is saved at every time in `tsave`,
            otherwise only the final state is returned.
        - **cartesian_batching** – If `True`, batched arguments are treated as separated
            batch dimensions, otherwise the batching is performed over a single
            shared batched dimension.
        - **progress_meter** – Progress meter indicating how far the solve has
            progressed. Defaults to a [tqdm](https://github.com/tqdm/tqdm) progress
            meter. Pass `None` for no output, see other options in
            [dynamiqs/progress_meter.py](https://github.com/dynamiqs/dynamiqs/blob/main/dynamiqs/progress_meter.py).
            If gradients are computed, the progress meter only displays during the
            forward pass.
        - **t0** – Initial time. If `None`, defaults to the first time in `tsave`.
        - **save_extra** _(function, optional)_ – A function with signature
            `f(QArray) -> PyTree` that takes a state or propagator as input and returns
            a PyTree. This can be used to save additional arbitrary data during the
            integration. The additional data is accessible in the `extra` attribute of
            the result object returned by the solvers.

    === "`dq.mesolve`"
        **Parameters**

        - **save_states** – If `True`, the state is saved at every time in `tsave`,
            otherwise only the final state is returned.
        - **cartesian_batching** – If `True`, batched arguments are treated as separated
            batch dimensions, otherwise the batching is performed over a single
            shared batched dimension.
        - **progress_meter** – Progress meter indicating how far the solve has
            progressed. Defaults to a [tqdm](https://github.com/tqdm/tqdm) progress

            integration. The additional data is accessible in the `extra` attribute of
            the result object returned by the solvers.

    === "`dq.sepropagator`"
        **Parameters**

        - **save_propagators** – If `True`, the propagator is saved at every time in
            `tsave`, otherwise only the final propagator is returned.
        - **progress_meter** – Progress meter indicating how far the solve has
            progressed. Defaults to a [tqdm](https://github.com/tqdm/tqdm) progress
            meter. Pass `None` for no output, see other options in
