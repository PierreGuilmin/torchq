    Note-: Result of running multiple simulations concurrently
        The resulting propagators are batched according to the
        leading dimensions of the Hamiltonian `H` and jump operators `jump_ops`.
        The behaviour depends on the value of the `cartesian_batching` option

        === "If `cartesian_batching = True` (default value)"
            The results leading dimensions are
            ```
            ... = ...H, ...L0, ...L1, (...)
            ```
            For example if:

            - `H` has shape _(2, 3, n, n)_,
            - `jump_ops = [L0, L1]` has shape _[(4, 5, n, n), (6, n, n)]_,

            then `propagators` has shape _(2, 3, 4, 5, 6, ntsave, n, n)_.
        === "If `cartesian_batching = False`"
            The results leading dimensions are
            ```
            ... = ...H = ...L0 = ...L1 = (...)  # (once broadcasted)
            ```
            For example if:

            - `H` has shape _(2, 3, n, n)_,
            - `jump_ops = [L0, L1]` has shape _[(3, n, n), (2, 1, n, n)]_,

            then `propagators` has shape _(2, 3, ntsave, n, n)_.
