# Solvers

**dynamiqs** provides differentiable solvers for three types of differential equations describing quantum systems:

- [sesolve](solvers/sesolve.md) for closed systems described by the Schr√∂dinger equation,
- [mesolve](solvers/mesolve.md) for open systems described by the Lindblad master equation,
- [smesolve](solvers/smesolve.md) for continuously measured systems described by the stochastic master equation.
