# Solvers

**dynamiqs** provides differentiable solvers for three types of quantum systems.

- [sesolve](solvers/sesolve.md) for closed system described by the Schr√∂dinger equation
- [mesolve](solvers/mesolve.md) for open systems described by the Lindblad master equation
- [smesolve](solvers/smesolve.md) for continuously measured systems described by a stochastic master equation
