# torchqdynamics
Quantum systems simulation with PyTorch.

This library provides differentiable solvers for the Schr√∂dinger Equation, the Lindblad Master Equation and the Stochastic Master Equation. All the solvers are implemented using PyTorch and can run on GPUs.

## Installation
Clone the repository, install the dependencies and install the repository in editable mode in any Python virtual environment:
```shell
# pip
pip install -e /path/to/torchqdynamics

# conda
conda develop /path/to/torchqdynamics
```

## Usage

## Contribute
Install developer dependencies:
```shell
pip install isort yapf toml
```

Run the following before each commit:
```shell
isort torchqdynamics
yapf -i -r torchqdynamics
```

Alternatively you can use `pre-commit` to run theses automatically before commit:
```shell
pip install pre-commit
pre-commit install
```
